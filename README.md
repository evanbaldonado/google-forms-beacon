# Google Forms Beacon
This repository contains example code for sending data to a Google Form using sendBeacon() after the user is finished with the page, as determined with visibilitychange. This is preferable to using beforeunload or unload, as explained [here](https://www.igvita.com/2015/11/20/dont-lose-user-and-app-state-use-page-visibility/).
